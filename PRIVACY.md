## Overview

This application ("YouTube Top Videos Search") is a web-based tool that uses the YouTube Data API v3 to search for and display publicly available YouTube videos based on user-specified keywords and filters.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

- **Search Queries**: The keywords and filters you enter in the search form
- **API Requests**: Parameters sent to YouTube's API (keyword, time range, region, etc.)
- **Server Logs**: Basic request logs for debugging and performance monitoring

### What We DON'T Collect

- ❌ Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- ❌ User accounts or login credentials
- ❌ Cookies or tracking data
- ❌ IP addresses (beyond standard server logs)
- ❌ Browser history or browsing behavior

## How We Use Data

The data we process is used solely to:

1. Execute your search requests via the YouTube Data API
2. Display search results to you
3. Cache results temporarily to improve performance and reduce API usage
4. Debug issues and monitor application performance

## Data Storage

- **Cache**: Search results are temporarily cached in server memory for up to 1 hour (configurable)
- **No Database**: We do not store any user data in a database
- **No Persistence**: All cached data is lost when the server restarts
